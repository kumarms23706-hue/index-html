<h2>India vs Australia Highlights, Women’s World Cup Semifinal: Jemimah Rodrigues’ ton helps INDW beat AUSW by 5 wickets, reach WC final.</h2></u</a>

<p><b>India beat Australia by five wickets to reach the finals of ICC Women's World Cup 2025 final at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on 
thursday </b></p>
<i>
<p> A century for ages by Jemimah Rodrigues led the India women’s team to a historic five-wicket win at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai on Thursday over Australia, as they qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 final. Earlier, Pheobe Litchfield’s fiery ton alongside blazing half-centuries from Ellyse Perry and Ash Gardner powered Australia to a mammoth 338 in 49.5 overs and set India the highest-ever target in the World Cup knockout match.

Coming into the crucial clash, Australia were unbeaten in the tournament, and the only game they did not win was against Sri Lanka, which ended as a no result due to rain. India, on the other hand, has finished in fourth place in the group stage after facing defeats to South Africa, Australia, and England.</p>

<h2>-"Women's cricket prepares to crown a new world champion"!</h2></a>

<p>The two finalists at this World Cup have crossed many barriers in the last decade or so and even over the last month.

<i>South Africa pulled themselves together after the embarrassment of 69 all out and 97 all out, while India made it to the knockouts without beating any of the three teams that finished above them on the points table. South Africa unearthed new finishers and new heroes. India dusted themselves off after losses that could so easily have been wins. And by the time the two teams traversed around India - via Colombo - and arrived in the knockouts, they ran into their nemesis. South Africa broke the hoodoo in Guwahati against England with an emphatic win and India enthralled the home crowd in Navi Mumbai by overpowering the mighty Australians.

We now head for a grand finish, the first ODI World Cup final that features neither Australia nor England, and will crown a new world champion on Sunday night.</p></i>
